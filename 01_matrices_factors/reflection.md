# 🧠 Reflection: Matrices & Factors

## ✅ What I learned:
- A **matrix** is like a table but must contain the same type of data (all numeric, all character, etc.)
- A **factor** is used for categorical data in R, especially helpful for stats modeling (like ANOVA)
- You can convert between factors and characters/numbers

## 😅 What was tricky:
- Remembering that R treats character strings as factors sometimes by default
- Understanding the difference between matrix vs data frame (matrix = one type only)

## 💡 I/O Psych Application:
- When analyzing survey data (e.g., Likert scales), converting responses to factors will be key
- Matrices help when doing numerical analysis or representing correlation matrices

## 🔁 What I want to review later:
- How to create labeled factors
- Matrix math operations (especially subsetting)
