# 🧰 Reflection: Utilities in R

## ✅ What I learned:
- How to use functions for **data structure inspection** like `str()`, `summary()`, and `typeof()`
- Useful **conversion functions** like `as.character()`, `as.numeric()`, etc.
- Intro to **regular expressions** with `grepl()`, `sub()`, and `gsub()`
- How to handle **dates and times** using `as.Date()`, `Sys.Date()`, and formatting options

## 😅 What was tricky:
- Remembering regex syntax and escaping special characters
- Working with date formats and figuring out the right formatting codes

## 💡 I/O Psych Application:
- Clean and validate large text datasets like survey responses or open-ended feedback
- Convert and compare dates for attendance, time tracking, or survey timelines
- Use regex to filter or flag keywords in qualitative responses

## 🔁 What I want to review later:
- More practice with complex regex patterns
- Time series functions for manipulating dates/times in larger datasets
