# 🔁 Reflection: Loops & Control Flow

## ✅ What I learned:
- How to use **`while` loops** to run code while a condition is true
- How to use **`for` loops** to iterate over elements in vectors, lists, and matrices
- How to control flow using **`if`**, **`else`**, **`next`**, and **`break`**

## 😅 What was tricky:
- Remembering when to use `next` vs `break`
- Looping over matrices and understanding how the loop index maps to rows/columns

## 💡 I/O Psych Application:
- Could be useful for automating repetitive data cleaning tasks
- Looping through survey questions or participants for conditional flagging or scoring

## 🔁 What I want to review later:
- Nested loops
- Loop alternatives like `apply()` family functions
