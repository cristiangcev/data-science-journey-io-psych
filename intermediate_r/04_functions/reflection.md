# 🧠 Reflection: Functions

## ✅ What I learned:
- How to define custom functions using `function()`
- The importance of function arguments and return values
- How to use default arguments and nested functions
- The concept of variable scope within functions

## 😅 What was tricky:
- Remembering when to return a value explicitly vs implicitly
- Understanding how R handles scope (especially with nested functions)

## 💡 I/O Psych Application:
- Functions will be useful for reusable calculations (e.g., engagement scoring)
- Can automate repetitive processes like cleaning or transforming survey data

## 🔁 What I want to review later:
- Writing functions that take and return data frames
- Passing functions into other functions (functional programming)
