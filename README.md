# ðŸ§  Data Science Learning Journey | I/O Psychology Focus

Hi there! Iâ€™m an I/O psychology master's candidate delving into Data Science and using this repo to document my learning journey. This includes hands-on practice, notes, mini-projects, and reflections as I learn R, statistics, and data science techniques relevant to workplace behavior and human systems.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Become fluent in R and RStudio
- Apply data science to I/O psychology concepts
- Practice reproducible, well-commented code
- Reflect and grow through self-guided learning

## ðŸ“… Learning Log
