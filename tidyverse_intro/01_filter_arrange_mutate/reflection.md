# 🧹 Reflection: Filter, Arrange, and Mutate

## ✅ What I learned:
- How to load and explore a dataset using `gapminder` and `dplyr`
- How to use `filter()` to select rows based on one or more conditions
- How to use `arrange()` to sort data by a specific column
- How to use `mutate()` to add or modify columns
- How to chain these verbs together for clear and powerful data transformations

## 😅 What was tricky:
- Remembering to use the pipe operator `%>%` to chain functions
- Understanding the difference between writing inside vs outside `mutate()`

## 💡 I/O Psych Application:
- Filter organizational data by department or time period
- Sort employee data by tenure, satisfaction, or performance
- Mutate columns to calculate new metrics like engagement scores or adjusted salaries

## 🔁 What I want to review later:
- More complex filters with multiple conditions
- Using `mutate()` for grouped calculations
