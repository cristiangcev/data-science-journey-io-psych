# 📊 Reflection: Grouping and Summarizing

## ✅ What I learned:
- How to use `summarize()` to calculate summary statistics for a dataset
- How `group_by()` helps summarize data by categories like year or continent
- How to use multiple grouping variables for multi-level summaries
- How to visualize grouped summaries using `ggplot2`

## 😅 What was tricky:
- Remembering to group *before* summarizing
- Managing column names when summarizing multiple variables

## 💡 I/O Psych Application:
- Summarize employee or survey data by department, role, or time period
- Compare metrics across locations or years
- Create simple visual summaries for leadership dashboards

## 🔁 What I want to review later:
- Using `n()` and `n_distinct()` in summaries
- Summarizing after filtering
- Advanced combinations of `group_by()`, `summarize()`, and `mutate()`
