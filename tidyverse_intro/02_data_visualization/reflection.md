# 📊 Reflection: Data Visualization with ggplot2

## ✅ What I learned:
- How to build scatter plots using `ggplot()` with `geom_point()`
- How to adjust axes using `scale_x_log10()` and `scale_y_log10()`
- How to add aesthetics like `color` and `size` to represent more variables
- How to use `facet_wrap()` and `facet_grid()` to split plots by categories

## 😅 What was tricky:
- Remembering when to use `aes()` vs placing arguments outside of it
- Getting log scales right for both axes without distorting visuals

## 💡 I/O Psych Application:
- Visualize engagement or performance by department, time, or demographics
- Use faceting to compare groups across multiple surveys or organizations
- Color and size help communicate multi-dimensional HR data

## 🔁 What I want to review later:
- More options in `theme()` to improve plot appearance
- Adding titles, captions, and legends for presentation
