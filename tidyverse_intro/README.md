# âœ¨ Introduction to the Tidyverse

This folder contains my chapter-by-chapter notes and practice code from the **Introduction to the Tidyverse** course on DataCamp. The course introduces the core functions of the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages and focuses on tidy data manipulation.

## Chapters so far:
- `01_filter_arrange_mutate/`: Filtering, sorting, and modifying columns with `dplyr`
- `02_data_visualization/`: Creating scatter plots, using log scales, adding aesthetics, and faceting with `ggplot2`

Each chapter folder includes:
- `reflection.md`: Personal notes and key takeaways
- `practice.R`: Code examples and applied exercises
