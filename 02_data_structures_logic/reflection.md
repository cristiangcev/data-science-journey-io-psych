# 🧠 Reflection: Data Frames, Lists, and Conditionals

## ✅ What I learned:
- **Data frames** store datasets with different variable types (like Excel tables). You can subset and reorder them easily.
- **Lists** can hold elements of different types (vectors, data frames, even functions). You can name and access parts of them using `$`, `[[]]`, or `[ ]`.
- **Conditionals** use logical operators (==, !=, >, & , |) and `if`, `else`, `ifelse()` to make decisions in code.

## 😅 What was tricky:
- Remembering when to use `[ ]`, `[[]]`, and `$` with lists
- Figuring out how indexing behaves differently in data frames vs lists

## 💡 I/O Psych Application:
- Use conditionals to flag at-risk employees based on engagement or performance scores
- Store different types of survey results in a list for structured analysis
- Data frames will be the backbone for any HR or org data work

## 🔁 What I want to review later:
- The difference between `if` and `ifelse()` in vectorized operations
- How to nest conditionals cleanly
